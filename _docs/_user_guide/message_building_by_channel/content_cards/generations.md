# In-App Messages Generations

Braze currently has three generations of in-app messages. Each comes with it own level of support. To take advantage of the newest features of our in-app messages, we recommend upgrading to the newest [Web]({{ site.baseurl }}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/initial_sdk_setup/#upgrading-the-sdk), iOS, and Android SDKs.
